# InfiniteQuoteList

An infinitely scrollable list of random quotes by famous people.

A simple project that uses two APIs:

The Go Quotes API (https://goquotes.docs.apiary.io/) to fetch random quotes and the people they can be attributed to
The Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch random pictures of (the most adorable) dogs
On starting up the app, four random quotes appear, in card-style. On scrolling to the bottom of the list, new cards with more random quotes are added.

As long as the user scrolls down on the list, new cards will continue to appear, making the list almost infinite.
